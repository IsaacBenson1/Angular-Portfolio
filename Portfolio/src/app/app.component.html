        <p>IDeaS is a company owned by SAS that does data analytics to perform revenue management 
          for the hospitality industry. It is the industry leader in this niche and is currently being 
          utilized by nearly every major hotel chain in the world. As an application developer intern at IDeaS,
           I was a part of the front-end team working on the company's flagship product, Casper. I gained expertise in 
           TypeScript-Angular and other TypeScript frameworks, and overall experience in web development and software engineering. 
           I performed a wide and varied array of bug fixes, added new and impactful features, and completed several tech-debt-related 
           projects. Working with my international team, I was able to optimize our NX library configuration and improve build times by 
           over 30%, an improvement that will benefit my team and Caspers users greatly moving forward.</p>

              I have assisted in instructing a class of 400 students on fundamental theories and
               applications of algorithms and data structures in java. I facilitate two lab sections of 30 students 
               each, presenting information and providing detailed explanations/examples for hands-on learning experiences. 
               I also assist in the development of core course materials such as writeups, rubrics,
               exams, and lab instructions, as well as the meticulous grading of labs, projects, and exams.	</p>

          <p>"JavaEngine" is the name of a project that I started in June of 2021. It is a 3D engine written entirely from scratch in java.
             It uses properties of linear algebra and projective geometry in order to achieve a form of rendering called rasterization.
            This engine is capable of loading obj files from blender, and has a movable camera. It uses no external libraries other than JFrame,
          which is just the window that the program runs in.</p>
