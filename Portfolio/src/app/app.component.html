        <p>IDeaS is a company owned by SAS that does data analytics to perform revenue management for the hospitality industry. It is the industry leader in this niche and is currently being utilized by nearly every major hotel chain in the world. As an application developer intern at IDeaS, I was apart of the frontend team working on the company's flagship product, Casper. I gained expertise of TypeScript-Angular and other TypeScript frameworks, and overall experience in web development and software engineering. I performed a wide and varied array of bug fixes, added new and impactful features, and completed several tech-debt related projects. Working with my international team, I was able to optimize our NX library configuration and improve build times by over 30%, an improvement that will benefit my team and Caspers users greatly moving forward.</p>
